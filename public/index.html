  Things to cover.

  Why I'm looking at c2?
    - attraction of clojurescript
    - experience with d3
    - possibility of client/server rendered views
    - fun

  Basics of c2
    - what it says it is
    - ex1, as an example of bind!
    - ex1 with generated vectors

  Unify
    - demonstrate object consistency with unify

  Cover Track
    - explain target: Bostock's A Bar Chart, Part 1
    - build bars
    - label bars
    - add grid-lines
    - "Et voil√†!"
 
  Wrap up

  <h2>intro</h2>
  <p>

  Working as a client side developer there have been scant opportunities for me
  to pursue my passion and use lisp in earnest.  ClojureScript has
  unequivocally removed that obstacle, bringing a modern and powerful lisp to
  javascript environments.

  </p>
  <p>

  At a glance, Clojure, a predominately functional language might not seem like
  a natural fit for client side development.  Much of the discussion in the
  javascript community seems to focus on mutable models, and finding ways to bind views
  onto those bits of mutable state. Can Clojure excel in such muddy waters?

  </p>
  <p>

  Not so long ago I might have thought not. Then I discovered d3.  Mike
  Bostocks d3 is (awesome) a javascript library for manipulating documents, but
  what makes it unique is its focus on "transformation not representation"
  which all sounds very functional!  I've been building applications with d3
  for a couple of years now, and have seen a more functional style of
  architecture reap many benefits.  
  
  </p> 

  <p>
  
  To get a feel for what building applications in clojurescript is like I've
  been doing a series of cover tracks (copying things already built).  Recently
  I've been focusing on a library called c2, which is heavily inspired by d3 but
  also takes many cues from clojure to give a idiomatic experience.

  <h2>c2 basics</h2>

  <p>before I jumped in and tried to carbon copy one of Mikes d3 demos I needed
  to get an idea of how c2 worked</p>
