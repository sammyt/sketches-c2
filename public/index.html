    <h1>Notes on c2</h2>
  </header>

  <p>Working as a client side developer there have been scant opportunities for
  me to pursue a passion and use lisp in earnest.  ClojureScript has
  unequivocally removed that obstacle, by bringing a modern and powerful lisp
  to javascript environments. Hurrah!</p>
  
  <p>At a glance, Clojure, a predominately functional language might not seem
  like a natural fit for client side development.  Much of the discussion in
  the javascript community seems to focus on mutable models, and finding ways
  to listen for changes in those models.  But despite the inevitability of state
  in the client a more functional approach to design can reap many rewards.</p>

  <p>To get a feel for what building applications in ClojureScript is like I've
  been doing a series of cover tracks (copying things already built).  Recently
  I've been focusing on a library called c2, which is heavily inspired by Mick
  Bostocks excellent d3 but also takes many cues from Clojure to give an
  idiomatic experience.  In this article I'll try to explain how I covered
  a simple chart originally built in d3.</p>

  <h2>c2 basics</h2>

  <p>Before jumping in its worth going over the basics of c2 to get a sense for
  its API.  Take a look at how to generate a simple ordered-list.</p>

  <pre>
  <code class="clojure">
(bind! ".ex-basic" 
  [:div
   [:ol
     [:li "wibble"]
     [:li "wobble"]
     [:li "woooo"]]])
  </code>
  </pre>

  <p>The code is almost alarmingly simple</p>

  <p>Breaking it down at little there is a call to a function named
  <code>bind!</code> which takes two parameters, a string css selector as
  a target and a clojure vector representing the desired dom structure.</p>

  <p><code>bind!</code> takes care of ensuring that the dom under the selector
  matches the structure of the vector.  It finds the target node, then walks
  the dom below ensuring it matches the vector provided.  It doesn't just brute
  force set innerHTML, it updates what it finds to match the desired state.
  Heres the output, as expected.</p>
  
  <div class="ex-basic output"></div>


  <p>Its not often we have a complete picture of the dom structure we want when
  we are authoring the code. In d3 rather than building each <code>li</code>
  element and setting the copy by hand we would bind some data to an expression
  which would generate each node based on a datum, so something like this.</p>

  <pre> <code class="javascript">
var sel = d3.select("ol")
  .selectAll("li")
  .data(["wibble", "wobble", "woooo"])

sel.enter().append("li").text(String)
  </code> </pre>

  <p>Take a look at how we could achieve the same thing in c2 and
  clojurescript.</p>

  <pre>
  <code class="clojure">
(bind! ".ex-basic"  
  [:div
   [:ol
     (map (fn [d] [:li d]) ["wibble" "wobble" "woooo"])]])
  </code>
  </pre>

  <p>From c2's perspective nothing has changed.  We are still parsing a fully
  formed vector to the <code>bind!</code> method, only this time we have
  generated the <code>:li</code> vectors on the fly using clojures
  <code>map</code> function.  This simple idea is very powerful, since we can
  run multiple <code>map</code> expressions, or anything else from clojures
  arsenal to generate the desired vector.  Also, we are no longer in the
  position of forcing all that data into an array bound to a top level node.
  We can use any data we have to hand at any point in the structure.

  
  <h2>Onto the Cover Track</h2>

  <p>Cover tracks are a nice way to get an idea of how a technology feels to
  work in, since you have a clear goal and a benchmark of complexity to view
  your solution in the light of. I'm covering a very simple d3 example here,
  but in doing so I got a great feel for using the language, tools and
  library.</p>

  <p>Take a look at the chart, and the required code in the <a
    href="http://mbostock.github.io/d3/tutorial/bar-1.html">Mikes original</a>
  (at the bottom).</p>

  <p>The chart has a simple structure, where each of the elements (bars, grid
  lines etc.) are all siblings, sized and positioned explicitly based on the
  data.  To get going I'll start by walking through some code for generating
  the bars.</p>

<pre><code class="clojure">
(bind! ".ex-bars"
  (let [data [4, 8, 15]
        width 200 
        height 60
        bar-height 20
        scale-x (scale/linear 
                  :domain [0 (apply max data)] 
                  :range  [0 width])]

    [:div [:div.chart
     [:svg {:width width, :height height}
     
      (map-indexed (fn [i d]
        [:rect {:width (scale-x d) 
                :height bar-height, 
                :y (* i bar-height)}]) data)]]]))
</code></pre>

  <p>I start with a <code>let</code> block to scope the values I'll need.  The
  data to render, and some pixel sizes to feed to the svg nodes. Then
  a function <code>scale-x</code> to size each bar relative to its data and the
  space it has to fill.  Rather than computing this manually I've used a c2's
  linear scale function.</p>

  <pre><code class="clojure">
scale-x (scale/linear 
          :domain [0 (apply max data)] 
          :range  [0 width])
  </code></pre>

  <p>The body of the expression uses those values to generate a representation
  of the nodes in vector form.  I'm aiming for something like you can see
  below.  Three rect elements with widths and positions relative to the
  data.</p>
  
  <pre><code class="clojure">
[:div [:div.chart
   [:svg {:width 200, :height 60}
      [:rect {:width 53.3  :height 20 :y 0}] 
      [:rect {:width 106.3 :height 20 :y 20}] 
      [:rect {:width 200   :height 20 :y 40}]]]]
  </code></pre>


  <p>I've used the <code>map-indexed</code> function to iterate over the data
  so I don't need to keep hold of a counter to increment the <code>y</code>
  value, then used the <code>scale-x</code> function to calculate the
  width.</p>

    <pre><code class="clojure">
(map-indexed (fn [i d]
  [:rect {:width (scale-x d) 
          :height bar-height, 
          :y (* i bar-height)}]) data)
  </code></pre>
  

  <p>Heres what that code snippet buys us.</p>

  <div class="ex-bars output"></div>

  <p>Generating the rest of the data structure of the chart follows the same
  pattern.  Bar labels are added as svg text nodes and positioned with the
  <code>scale-x</code> function. They are added after the rects in the vector
  to ensure they are on top of the bars when displayed.</p>

  <p>The grid lines and associated labels gave me a change to try out a little
  more of c2's API. <code>c2.ticks.search</code> is a function that given
  a data domain will search for appropriate tick points at which to draw
  grid lines.</p>

  <pre><code class="clojure"> (:ticks (ticks/search domain)) </code></pre>

  <p>The search function returns a number of properties related to ticks, but
  I just needed the tick data points at which to render grid lines found under
  the <code>:ticks</code> keyword.  The resulting sequence contains the
  following values.</p>

  <pre><code class="clojure">
(0 10 20 30 40)
  </code></pre>
 
  <p>I can then reuse the <code>scale-x</code> function with those values to
  find the x coordinates to draw the lines and position the text.</p>

  <p>Here is the full code, with bars, bar labels, grid lines and grid labels all
  being built.</p>

  <pre><code class="clojure">
(bind! ".ex-full"
  (let [data [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] 
        width 440 
        height 140
        bar-height 20
        domain [0 (apply max data)]
        scale-x (scale/linear 
                  :domain domain 
                  :range  [0 (- width 20)])
        ticks (:ticks (ticks/search domain))]

    [:div [:div
     [:svg.chart {:width width, :height height}
      [:g {:transform "translate(10,15)"}
       
       ;; grid line labels 
       (map (fn [tick] 
             [:text.rule {:x (scale-x tick) 
                          :dy -3 
                          :text-anchor "middle"} tick]) ticks) 

       ;; grid lines
       (map (fn [tick] 
             (let [x (scale-x tick)] 
               [:line {:x1 x :x2 x :y2 120 :stroke "#ccc"}])) 
       ticks)


       ;; bars
       (map-indexed (fn [i d]
        [:rect {:width (scale-x d) 
                :height bar-height, 
                :y (* i bar-height)}]) data)

       ;; bar labels
       (map-indexed (fn [i d]
        [:text {:x (scale-x d) 
                :y (+ (/ bar-height 2) (* i bar-height))
                :text-anchor "end"
                :dx -3
                :dy ".35em"} d]) data)]]]]))
  </code></pre>

  <p>The result is almost identical to the original.  There are some minor
  differences like the number of ticks, but I thinks its a pretty comprehensive
  cover, even if its a simple target.</p>
  
  <div class="ex-full output"></div>
  
  <p>What stands out for me is how easy it is to look at the code generating
  the vector and understand the shape of the DOM that will be generated.  There
  is very little mental processing needed to go from code to presentation.
  I didn't have to think (or code) in terms of how I wanted the chart to be
  built, I focused instead on what I wanted built.</p>

  <h2>A little more c2</h2>

  <p>One thing that the cover track didn't address is how to manage any form of
  animation. c2 doesn't include any animation functions, but working in the
  browser we can leverage any of the in built capabilities like CSS transforms
  or svg animate nodes.</p>

  <p>All great in theory but I still wanted to prove it to myself with another
  example.</p>

  <div class="ex-moving output"></div>

  <p>Here the height of each bar is animating thanks to a simple CSS
  transform.</p>

  <pre><code class="css">
transition: height 400ms ease;
  </code></pre>

  <p>Aside from the little snippet of code at the bottom to keep the data
  rotating this is exactly the same as the examples above.</p>

  <pre><code class="clojure">
(defn draw-chart! [data]
  (bind! ".ex-moving"
    [:div [:div.chart  
      (let [scale-x (scale/linear :domain [0 30] :range [0 100])]

        (map-indexed 
          (fn [i d] [:div.col 
                     {:style {:height (str (scale-x d) "px")
                              :left (str (* i 21) "px")}}]) data))]]))


(let [seed (range 30)]
  (draw-chart! seed)
  (go 
    (loop [data seed] 
      (&lt! (timeout 3000))
      (draw-chart! data)
        (recur (vec (cons (last data) (drop-last data)))))))
  </code></pre>
 
  <p>There is one other important thing that the animation demonstrates.
  Which is that c2 doesn't destroy the nodes each time its run but updates
  them in place.  If it was just clobbering the <code>innerHTML</code>
  property of the target we wouldn't get any animation at all.</p> 

  <h2>Wrapping up</h2>

  <p>I really enjoy working with d3, I think its a fantastic library so I was
  curious what working with c2 would be like since at a surface level its API
  has diverged a long way from d3.  I have some experience porting d3's ideas
  to other languages having built a python version myself.  I stuck quite
  rigidly to d3's API, and I think the end result was a little uncomfortable.
  In ClojureScript c2's <code>bind!</code> feels very natural. There is no
  interaction with the DOM, only data.  As the author puts it "the view is
  data".</p>

  <p>That idea of the view as data opens up some compelling opportunities,
  since pure functions can generate the desired vector representation based on
  just the data.  Those pure functions (free from side effects like
  <code>appendChild</code>) can be used both in the client or on the server.
  I've done quite a bit of work trying to cleanly get d3 code to run in server
  environments, but the global pervasive nature of the DOM API throws up some
  real complications.  By adopting this lisp like mantra of code as data c2 has
  sidestepped all those issues from the start.</p>
