  Things to cover.

  Why I'm looking at c2?
    - attraction of clojurescript
    - experience with d3
    - possibility of client/server rendered views
    - fun

  Basics of c2
    - what it says it is
    - ex1, as an example of bind!
    - ex1 with generated vectors

  Unify
    - demonstrate object consistency with unify

  Cover Track
    - explain target: Bostock's A Bar Chart, Part 1
    - build bars
    - label bars
    - add grid-lines
    - "Et voil√†!"
 
  Wrap up

  As a client side developer there have been scant opportunities for me to
  pursue my passion and use lisp in earnest.  ClojureScript has unequivocally
  removed that obstacle, bringing a modern and powerful lisp to javascript
  environments.

  <p>

  At a glance, Clojure, a predominately functional language might not seem like
  a natural fit for client side development.  Much of the discussion in the
  community seem to focus on mutable models, and finding ways to bind views onto
  those bits of mutable state. Can Clojure excel in such muddy waters?

  Not so long ago I might have thought not. Then I discovered d3.  Mike
  Bostocks d3 is a javascript library for manipulating documents, but what
  makes it unique is its focus on transformation not representation which all
  sounds very functional!
